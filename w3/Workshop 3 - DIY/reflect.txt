This week and in this workshop, the concepts of classes and the advantages of them over structs, member functions, and the empty state were introduced to me. Classes are data structures that can host functions as well as data members and variables. The difference between structures and classes shows itself here, where we can also address member functions within a class and use them in our code. Another main difference between a struct and a class is the access level to the members; the members in a struct are public and can be accessed from everywhere in the code. The class, however, is private by default. The public members can be accessed from anywhere outside the class scope but within the program; we can access them by using the '.' operator. We cannot view or modify the private members outside the class; they can only be reached through the functions within the class. In the Bar class in this week's workshop, the variables b_title, b_fill, and b_sampleValue cannot be accessed outside the scope of that class and outside the definition of the member functions of that class.
A safe empty state is a state that we declare for the objects so they would contain an initial value that is not user-defined. The thing about the empty state is that the objects that are in a safe state are not actually empty, we assign them values; one of the benefits of the empty state shows itself in conditional statements, where we want to check the validity of an object. In our program, we check if the user has prompted the correct sample value of the Bar (between 0 and 100), and if not, we would set the objects to a safe empty state.
Another thing I learned during this workshop was some beneficial functions of the input/output library such as width (setw) and fill (setfill). I used those functions to have a better-looking output.
