This course has finally come to its end; I loved it. When I found with C++ coding can get easier and also be more sophisticated than C language, I was thrilled. Expanding my previous knowledge of programming in C and learning more things about those subjects was a great thing that OOP244 offered. This project got more complicated as milestones passed. Every milestone's tasks were clear and kind of easy to tackle, but it was in the last milestone that I found how much of a huge amount of work I have put into this COVID-19 program. I still get a bit confused and sometimes cannot fully comprehend the code when I debug it from int main() and I step into all of the function calls. The whole program is a course of C++ learning for itself. I will definitely review this program and also other real-world programs in Github before the next semester starts. The most interesting part about this course was probably the overloading; it was in the final milestone that I understood the power of overloading and how it can ease the burden. I still don't like templates and lag at them a lot; I have to rewatch the lectures and watch/read additional sources regarding it because I know I am going to be dealing with templates a lot more the next semester. At last, I want to use this moment and thank Michael for his dedication to the course and his ambition to teach us as best he could. Sorry if we weren't enough participating :)
